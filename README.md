# TracerX
TracerX is a logging framework for .NET.  It has three major components.

1. **TracerX-Logger.dll** - The DLL you must use in your application to send logging to various destinations, primarily a file.
1. **TracerX-Viewer.exe** - A Windows Forms GUI application for viewing log files with powerful filtering, coloring, and navigation features.  It has a "start page" that lists all the logs available on your computer or a remotely connected computer.  Just click one to view it.
1. **TracerX-Service.exe** - This is an optional component that enables viewing logs on remote servers without using shares. 

The best documentation currently available is the CodeProject article at https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/23424/TracerX-Logger-and-Viewer-for-NET.
