5.1 
Changed target framework to be the client-only subset.

5.2 
Allow each Logger to have it's own BinaryFile and/or TextFile.
Fixed bug in how FullFilePolicy applies to text files.
Use SHA1 hash for password protection.
Added encryption for password protected files.


Notes:

Doc: XML configuration applies only to default file(s).
Consider assigning Logger.BinaryFile to Logger from other AppDomain.

Test: Call ThreadData.ResetBinaryFileStateData with and without flags.MethodEntry.
