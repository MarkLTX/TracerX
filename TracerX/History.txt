CHANGE HISTORY in reverse chronological order.

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.8.011209.0")] // V8, 2007/Dec/09
o Logger
  o Use the "StandardData" logger to control the logging that is 
    automatically done when the log file is opened.
  o Added XML support for setting the destination format strings.
  o Added EventLogging.InternalEventOffset so users can control
    the event numbers of internally logged events.
o Viewer
  o Added auto-refresh feature with ability to keep the scroll position
    at the end of the log after every refresh (auto and manual refreshes).
  o Retain filter setting across refreshes.  
  o Allow filtering by text.
  o Support wildcards in text filtering and searching.
  o Wrap text by default in the full text window.
  o Changed "Select All" button to "Copy All" button in the full text window.
  o Pre-select the search text in the Find dialog.
  o Ensure lines shown in full text window end in "\r\n".
  o Show file name in title bar.
  o Show exe directory in about box.
  o Added ability to view the Apache License from the About dialog.
  o Fixed bug causing thread names to be duplicated when file is re-loaded.
  o Fixed bug causing long text messages to be truncated when all columns are copied.
o General
  o Added LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt to the source files comply with the 
    Apache License Version 2.0.

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.7.011006.0")] // V7, 2007/Oct/06
o Logger
  o Added support for logging to Trace.WriteLine, the event log, and the console.
  o Major code reorganization.  Many items were marked "Obsolete" but should still work.
  o Now generating XML documentation.

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.6.010919.0")] // V6, 2007/Sep/19
o Viewer
  o Fixed weird behavior on some dialogs, where the cursor would always
    change to the resizing cursor in the title bar.  The close button
    in the title bar could not be clicked.

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.6.010918.0")] // V6, 2007/Sep/18
o Viewer
  o Added an About dialog.
o Logger
  o BUG FIX - Logging very long strings can somtimes corrupt the log file so
    the viewer cannot read the circular part of the log.
  o Automatically register the ExceptionRenderer.

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.5.010813.0")] // V5, 2007/Aug/13
o Viewer
  o Allow thread names and thread numbers to be filtered independently, since
    the names of thread pool threads can change with each incarnation.
  o Added an option to use the "thousands separator" char in line numbers.
    This is on by default.
  o Save the last 10 search strings in the Find dialog.
o Logger
  o Log some standard information at the beginning of the log file, including
    the EXE's file version, assembly version, and path.  Also the OS version,
    current directory, and commad line.
  o Added an option to suppress logging of potentially sensitive information
    such as the user's domain/account name and machine name.
  o Added a custom renderer for Exception objects since Exception.ToString()
    does not render the Data property.  This is disabled by default because
    SQLdm is about to "code freeze".

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.4.010801.0")] // V4, 2007/Aug/01
o Viewer
  o Added Filter dialog for selecting Loggers, Trace Levels, and Threads to 
    filter by.
  o Added Options dialog with option to show relative or absolute values in
    the Time column.
  o Added a context menu to the column headers for column-specific tasks,
    such as filtering on the selected column.
  o Added an option to the regular context menu to designate the selected row
    as the "zero time" row for relative time values.
  o Added an option to the regular context menu to view the message text in a 
    text window (handy for long messages).  Also, double-clicking a row 
    launches the text window, unless the row is expandable/collapsible.
  o Unnamed threads are given default names based on thread number (e.g.
    "Thread 1").
o Logger    
  o Automatically open an alternate log file if the primary log file is in use 
    by another process.  This allows you to run multiple instances of the same
    exe and still get logging for each instance.
  o Added an option to treat recycled thread pool threads as new threads.  This
    is based on the fact that a thread's name is reset to null when the thread
    is returned to the thread pool.
  o Added an option to limit the number of times TracerX will write an event
    about unhandled exceptions.  Set this to 0 if you don't want TracerX to
    log any events about your app's unhandled exceptions (because you have
    your own code to log them, right?).  

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.3.010509.0")] // V3, 2007/May/09
o Changed application icon from RacerX image due to copyright issue.
o Never display more than 259 chars in the Text column in the viewer.  Testing 
  has proven that the viewer (i.e. the ListView control) will render only the
  first 260 chars.  Longer strings are simply truncated.
  Strings exactly 260 chars long CRASH the viewer in comctl32.dll!
  This may not happen depending on which version of comctl32.dll is present,
  but has been observed on two machines.
o Added a .tx1 filter to the OpenFileDialog.

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.010501.0")] // V2, 2007/May/01
This version fixes a bug in LogInfoCall, LogDebugCall, etc. that was caused by method 
inlining in X64 release builds.  The code assumed that the appropriate stack frame was always 
the fourth one on the stack.  The fourth stack frame in X64 release builds may not be
correct (and may not even exist) due to inlining.  The code was changed
to search for the first stack frame for a method not in the Logger class.
