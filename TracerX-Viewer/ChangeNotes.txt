IDEAS:

1)	Add logger option to use ManagedThreadID instead of a counter for thread IDs.  This is
	complicated because in a multi-session log file the current viewer always adds the max
	thread ID of the previous session the thread IDs of the next session to keep the IDs
	unique. This would not be desirable if using the actual ManagedThreadID but the viewer
	would not be able know if that is the case or not unless the setting were saved in the
	log file.  Also, each session can independently use or not use that option.
